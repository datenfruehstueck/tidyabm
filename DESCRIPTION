Description: tidyABM is designed to streamline the process of setting up, 
    running, and documenting Agent-Based Models (ABM) using the principles of 
    tidy data. It thus allows researchers to easily organize, manipulate, and 
    visualize ABMs in a structured, coherent, and intuitive manner, built on 
    tidyverse conventions to efficiently build and explore ABMs while ensuring 
    readability, reproducibility, and transparency.
